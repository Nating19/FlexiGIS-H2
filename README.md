# FlexiGIS-H2: an open source GIS-based tool for modelling urban hydrogen potential.

FlexiGIS-H2 stands for Flexibilisation in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) - Hydrogen. The tool extracts, filters and categorises the geo-referenced urban energy infrastructure, simulates local electricity generation from distributed energy resources, and hydrogen production potential from residential solar photovoltaic (PV) surplus.

## System requirements

FlexiGIS-H2 is developed and tested on Linux (Ubuntu 22.04.5). The tools and software used in FlexiGIS-H2 and their versions are listed in the following:

- Operating system: Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS, Release: 22.04, Codename: jammy
- Python: 3.11.0

Python: Ensure you can run python (with version 3 and above) on your OS. Python can be downloaded following this [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or download the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distro.

## Getting Started

To use the FlexiGIS-H2 spatial-temporal platform download the FlexiGIS-H2 code and data folder as a zip file or clone the repository from the FlexiGIS-H2 GitHub repo. After downloading the FlexiGIS-H2 code, unzip the folder FlexiGIS-H2 in the location of your choice. The file structure of the FlexiGIS-H2 code folder is as follows:
